# Random Code
Solutions (or partial solutions) to some random (but interesting) problems. To do some small problems I usually prefer online compilers, so the stuff here are probably the ones that cannot be done online due to their limitations and restrictions. Which means some of these problems may require extended resource allocation to complete (for example - Java Heap size increase). Most of the problems are from [CodeSignal] (https://app.codesignal.com).

### Index
- `AdjacentSquare` - Given an array, re-arrange it in such a way that any 2 adjacent elements (circular) sum to give a perfect square.
- `AntiPrimes` - Generates first few (tested upto 500) [Anti-Primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_composite_number). __Requires increased Java heap size__.
- `BigFib` - Finds `n`th fibonacci number, given the 2 starting values `a` and `b`. `n` is expected to be very large, and so would be the result, thus it is returned modded with some number (probably `1e9 + 7`). Run time is logarithmic.
- `DiceRolls2` - Solution of [this] (https://app.codesignal.com/challenge/x5BYvZjQDmQDDb5F9) problem.
- `FactorialLastNonZeroDigit` - Finds the last `k` digits of `n!` after all the trailing zeroes of `n!` are removed. `n`, ofcourse can be large.
- `FactorialTrailingZeroes` - Finds the number of trailing zeroes of `n!`.

**Will be completed eventually**
